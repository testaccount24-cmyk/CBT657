Hi Sam,

This morning I sent the following:


    I've created a set of JCL to build a single-volume RESCUE
    system.  I used JCL that another system programmer had
    modified from CBT File #164 (I believe).

    The result is a PDS with a plan (member $PLAN) and JCL that
    will create a z/OS 1.4 compatible single-volume RESCUE
    system.  It also includes a $USAGE member that walks you
    through the restore and usage of the RESCUE system.  I
    thought that this might be useful to some.

Well, I've updated the RESCUE system and have a new XMI file for
you...it's attached.  I might have a future update that allows
the RESCUE system to start a working TCPIP.

Thanks and have a great holiday season!
